# VLC Youtube Playlist Parser
Lua plugin to parse Youtube playlists

### Prerequisites and Compatibility

- [cURL](https://curl.se/) should be installed on the operating system.
- Plugin tested on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa). Should be functional on any operating system that supports VLC and cURL.
- The plugin may cause an empty command prompt to flash on the screen for every 50 playlist items on Windows. Unfortunately, I do not know how to mitigate it.

### Installation

To install the script refer to [this guide.](https://techblogup.com/play-a-youtube-playlist-in-vlc-player/)

### Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Guillaume Le Maout, Kai Gillmann, Aaron Hill, and Matteo Federico Zazzetta for their contributions upon which this version of the plugin is based.
